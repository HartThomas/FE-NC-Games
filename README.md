## NC GAMES by THOMAS HART

This build is deployed at https://helpful-lamington-21039f.netlify.app/

This was built as my first front end react project. It is a website where reviews have been posted and people can read, vote and comment on them.

## Usage

If you want to comment on a review you have to be logged in. If you want to login pick a user to impersonate(no password required), which will give you the power to comment or delete that user's comments. This obviously isn't very secure but I trust you...

You can click any of the categories on the left to be shown only reviews from that category. Also you can chose what the reviews should be ordered by and whether that order is ascending or descending.
